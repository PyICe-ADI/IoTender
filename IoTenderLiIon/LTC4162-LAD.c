LTC4162: Advanced Synchronous Switching Battery Charger and PowerPath Manager

@verbatim
The LTC®4162-L is an advanced synchronous switching battery charger and
PowerPath manager that seamlessly manages power distribution from input sources
such as wall adapters, backplanes, solar panels, etc. and a rechargeable
battery. A high resolution telemetry system provides extensive information on
circuit voltages, currents, battery resistance and temperatures which can all be
read back over the serial interface. The serial interface can also be used to
configure many of the charging parameters including termination algorithms as
well as numerous system status alerts. The LTC4162-L can charge Lithium-Ion cell
stacks as high as eight cells with up to 3.2A of charge current. The power path
topology decouples the output voltage from the battery allowing a portable
product to start up under very low battery voltage conditions. The LTC4162-L is
available in an I²C adjustable version as well as 4.0V, 4.1V and 4.2V fixed
voltage versions all with and without MPPT enabled by default. The LTC4162-L is
available in the 28-pin 4mm × 5mm × 0.75mm QFN surface mount package.

 *  @ingroup LTC4162-LAD
 *  @brief LTC4162-LAD lightweight, hardware agnostic, embeddable C Communication
 *  Library.
 *
 * Communication  is  bit-field based as well as whole-register based. This library
 * automatically masks and right-justifies bit fields.
 *
 * This C library provides a header file with the complete definitions of registers
 * and  bit  fields  within  those  registers, and routines to read and write those
 * registers and individual bit-fields.
 *
 * Outside  of  the  Linduino  environment,  this  library  can  be  built with any
 * standard  C  compiler  and  can  be  used with different I2C/SMBus communication
 * hardware  simply  by  swapping  out  the  pointers  to appropriate user-supplied
 * functions   *@ref   smbus_write_register   and   *@ref  smbus_read_register.  An
 * example  is  provided  using  the  i2c-tools  Linux kernel driver which has been
 * tested  on  the  BeagleBone  Black  Linux  single board computer. It can also be
 * readily  adapted  to  common  microcontrollers  with  minimal  memory  impact on
 * embedded systems.
 *
 * A higher level hardware agnostic Python communication library is also available.
 *
 * Please   visit   http://www.linear.com/product/LTC4162#code  or  contact  the
 * factory at 408-432-1900 or www.linear.com for further information.

     is VERY dependent on your specific hardware.

     Linux, for example, allows multiple programs
     to open and read or write the i2c device at the same time.
     This may cause surprising behavior like "lost writes"
     when multiple processes concurrently attempt
     read-modify-writes of distinct bitfields
     residing in the same register.

     In Linux, one way to avoid this is to use flock(2), which
     blocks until an exclusive lock is acquired.
