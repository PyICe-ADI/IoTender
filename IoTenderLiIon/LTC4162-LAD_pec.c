LTC4162: Advanced Synchronous Switching Battery Charger and PowerPath Manager

@verbatim
The LTC®4162-L is an advanced synchronous switching battery charger and
PowerPath manager that seamlessly manages power distribution from input sources
such as wall adapters, backplanes, solar panels, etc. and a rechargeable
battery. A high resolution telemetry system provides extensive information on
circuit voltages, currents, battery resistance and temperatures which can all be
read back over the serial interface. The serial interface can also be used to
configure many of the charging parameters including termination algorithms as
well as numerous system status alerts. The LTC4162-L can charge Lithium-Ion cell
stacks as high as eight cells with up to 3.2A of charge current. The power path
topology decouples the output voltage from the battery allowing a portable
product to start up under very low battery voltage conditions. The LTC4162-L is
available in an I²C adjustable version as well as 4.0V, 4.1V and 4.2V fixed
voltage versions all with and without MPPT enabled by default. The LTC4162-L is
available in the 28-pin 4mm × 5mm × 0.75mm QFN surface mount package.

 *
 *  This is an implementation of the 8-bit CRC which can optionally
 *  be used for SMBus Packet Error Checking.
 *
 *  Both bit-wise and byte-wise implementations are included to trade
 *  program storage space against execution speed optimization.
